        <h3>Reading is:</h3>
         <p>
             
             the soul of man and the window of the soul to the world. You are what you read, and the more you read, the more you rise and the more you understand, the more you learn.
              <br>
             Reading makes a person move between history while he is in his place, and learns past experiences and future expectations, all of this between the pages of the book and knowledge.  And compulsion to read is the means of transmitting knowledge from people to people without effort, hardship or trial. 
             <br>
             Reading elevates the status and position of its owner, and scholars of all times have a special and distinguished position, unlike other people.
            <br>
                     Reading is
 
             What builds a person's personality, evaluates him, and evaluates his skills
            
 
             It is also the reason for his brilliance in all aspects of life and his creativity in his work
            
             The educated, informed, conscious person is aware of the ways of progress and advancement
            
             A time before others, he will have all the means of knowledge and news
            
             Advanced, modern, new news and talk in the fields of
            
             Different sciences and his field of specialization, so he would have a head start
            
             Ahead of other peers and all because of reading.
