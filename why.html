    <h3>why did we read ?</h3>
    <p>
        Everyone who is interested in reading and learning knows that reading has a special passion and magic.
         Once you finish a book, you find the passion wandering around you to meet another book. How do you know what a passion is for reading? You will feel a lot of things with every sentence, every line, every page, and every chapter.
         <br>
         <div class="w">
            <div class="y">
                <p> As you read, you will find that you will change your situation and your perceptions with each page. You will find that you gain a lot of different information. You will find that your feelings differed from the beginning of the book to the end. You will find that you have become a new person and that there has been a change in you and your personality.</p>

        You will find that you have become different and your view of the world around you is different. 
         If you try to read the books of history and reflect on them and see the rise and fall of civilizations,
          the rise and collapse of kingdoms, the existence and extinction of peoples, 
          if you read about every nation and its effects and news, 
          if you follow the events of history and the changes that occurred in humanity from ancient times until now,
           you will find that you have traveled while you are in your place.  For all those different places and times,
            you will find that your ability to analyze and anticipate has become stronger,
             you will find that you have become more aware of the reality around you and you will understand many signs and hints that most people do not pay attention to.
               Then you will realize that you have evolved through your reading.
